QPi Education worked with the science and engineering teacher, Ms. Angela Johnson, in 10th grade science. Although the school already had Raspberry Pi, QPi Education brought new content that could expand upon the existing Raspberry Pi kit. Ms. Johnson came to QPi Education’s educator workshop at UC Berkeley to learn about Raspberry Pi and its separate use cases. After attending the workshop, she eagerly wanted to bring this to her class of 24 students.</p><a href="https://medium.com/@qpieducation/pinole-valley-high-school-meets-raspberry-pi-robotics-c51d7a1bac20" target="_blank" class="button_hollow_blue centered w-button">LEARN MORE</a></div>

Jose Cebrian Marquez, Richmond High’s 10th grade engineering teacher, had spearheaded a successful DonorsChoose campaign to crowdfund the Raspberry Pi projects for last year’s class. This year, he has been able to utilize the same materials with an improved curriculum. He ran the course for approximately 60 students in total, and plans to pilot a Spanish version of the course for his English Language Development (ELD) students.</p><a href="https://medium.com/@qpieducation/richmond-highs-spring-pilot-success-fb9404681fbd" target="_blank" class="button_hollow_blue centered w-button">LEARN MORE</a></div>

Even the school’s student alumni return to volunteer and support the continued education of these attending students. The wonderful robotics facilitators, Gerry Maddalozzo and Helen Gee, brought a robotics class to the students this summer.
